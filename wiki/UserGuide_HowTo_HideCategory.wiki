= How to hide or display all items in an internal or custom category, or a rule =

When you assign a category to a bar its displayed by default.

If you want to hide a category from normal view (they always display in edit mode) you need to set the category mode to hidden.

  * Enter edit mode

  * Click on the bar where the category is assigned

  * Under `Categories assigned`, Mouse over the category type to bring up a list of categories.  You'll note that the categories will be coloured either green (display) or red (hide)

  * Mouse over the category you want to change to bring up the next menu

  * From that menu click on `Hide` to toggle the categories hidden status (it will tick or untick this option and change the colour of the category in the parent menu)

  * Exit Edit mode and your category will now be either hidden or displayed depending on the choice you made.
