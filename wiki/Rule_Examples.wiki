= Example Rules =

== items with resistances on them ==

{{{
tooltip( "%+%d+ %a+ resist" )
}}}

  * `%+` = match a plus (`+`) character

  * `%d+` = match 1 or more digits (numbers)

  * `<space>` = match actual text - a space

  * `%a+` = match 1 or more letters (ie a single word, in this case the type of resistance)

  * `<space>` = match actual text - a space

  * `resist` = match actual text - resist 


== items that are part of a set ==

{{{
tooltip( "%sset:" )
}}}

  * `%s` = matches a space (we use this because leading spaces are removed from arguments and we want to make sure we don't get a word that ends in set)

  * `set:` = match actual text - set:

note that this will match any item that is in a set, which is a bit pointless by itself, so you'll need to be more specific.

{{{
 tooltip( "%sset:" ) and tooltip( "garona's battlegear" )
}}}

if your set name is unique then you can just search on that by itself.
