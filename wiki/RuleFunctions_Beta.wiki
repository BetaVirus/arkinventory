= Rule Functions =

== Basics ==

  * all function names are case sensitive they need to be lowercase

  * the logic operators *`and`*, *`or`*, *`not`* _must_ be in lowercase

  * the arguments passed to a function are normally case insensitive (converted to lower case for matching purposes), unless that function specifically requires an exact case match (eg periodictable)

  * leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from all arguments

  * rules are validated before being saved so you cannot save an invalid rule

  * if for some reason a rule becomes damaged (most likely because of code changes) it will be flagged as damaged and not be used until it's manually corrected and resaved

  * nearly all the rules can take multiple arguments separated by commas, in those cases it functions as an explicit or. eg `name( "scroll", "elixir", "potion" )` is equivalent to `name( "scroll" ) or name( "elixir" ) or name( "potion" )`
