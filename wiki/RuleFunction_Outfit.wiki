#summary Rule Functions > Outfit

= outfit( set1, ..., setN ) =

Matches items in sets from outfit mods, eg Outfitter, !ItemRack, Blizzard !EquipmentManager

== Arguments ==

  * set1...N (string) = outfit name

== Remarks ==

  * if passed no arguments will return true if the item is in any set

  * dynamically chooses depending on which outfit mod is active

  * !ClosetGnome uses the Blizzard !EquipmentManager

  * !ItemRack is currently functional using the 2.0 beta of !ItemRack

== Issues ==

  * after changing the set an item belongs to in the outfit mod you may need to use the reload menu option in !ArkInventory to have it update to the new category

== Examples ==

  * `outfit( "arcane resist" )`

  * `outfit( "fishing" )`

  * `outfit( )`
