#summary Rule Function > Bag

= bag( arg1, ..., argN ) =

Checks if any of the supplied arguments match the bag number an item is in.


== Arguments ==

  * arg1...N (numeric) = bag position

== Remarks ==
  * bag numbers are not the blizzard ids, they are just the position the bag is in, ie from 1 to x (where is is the total number of bags for that location)

  * if you use the same settings for two locations, eg bag and bank you will need to include the `location( )` function in the rule as well if you want to differentiate between locations.

== Examples ==

  * `bag( 1 ) and loc( "vault" )`

  * `bag( 1, 2, 7 )`
