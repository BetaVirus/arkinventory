= Rule Functions =

== Basics ==

  * function names are case sensitive, they need to be lowercase

  * the Lua logic operators *`and`*, *`or`*, *`not`* need to be in lowercase

  * the arguments passed to a function are normally case insensitive (converted to lower case for matching purposes), unless that function specifically requires an exact case match (eg periodictable)

  * leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from all arguments

  * code changes can cause a rule to become "damaged", it that happens it will be flagged as damaged and will not be used until it is corrected and resaved

  * where a rule takes multiple arguments it functions as an explicit or. eg `name( "scroll", "elixir", "potion" )` is equivalent to `name( "scroll" ) or name( "elixir" ) or name( "potion" )`
