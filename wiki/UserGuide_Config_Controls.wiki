== Monitor ==

Monitors for changes to this location.  If you never want !ArkInventory to manage a specific location you can disable this option to save some cpu processing.

Some locations cannot have this option deselected.  They will always get scanned when an update event happens.

== Save ==

Saves this locations data, if this option is de-selected then, for example, if you leave the bank all bank data will be purged.

The Bag, Keyring, Pet and Mount data cant be deselected as it's always there, that data is purged on logout instead.

== Notify ==

If enabled a notification message is printed every time data is purged for this location

== Override ==

If enabled allows !ArkInventory to override the blizzard windows for this location with it's own

== Anchor Point ==

Defines which point of the !ArkInventory window to anchor (keep in the same spot on screen)

== Lock ==

If enabled will lock the !ArkInventory window in place so it cannot be moved around

== Settings ==

Assigns a setting for this location.  Settings are like mini profiles, each location has it's own default but you can change it here if, for example, you want to use the same settings as another location so they get displayed in the same way.
