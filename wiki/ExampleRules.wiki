= Example Rules =

== items with resistances on them ==

{{{
tooltip( %+%d+ %a+ resist )
}}}
  * `%+` = match a plus (`+`) character
  * `%d+` = match 1 or more digits (numbers)
  * `<space>` = matches a space
  * `%a+` = match 1 or more letters (in this case the type of resistance)
  * `<space>` = matches a space
  * `resist` = match the actual text resist 


== items that are part of a set ==

{{{
tooltip( %sset: )
}}}

  * `%s` = matches a space (we use this because leading spaces are removed from arguments and we want to make sure we don't get a word that ends in set)
  * `set:` = match the actual text set:
