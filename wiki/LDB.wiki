= LDB (!LibDataBroker) Objects =

!ArkInventory comes with several LDB objects that you can chose to enable via your LDB display mod that you use.

(note that !ArkInventory doesnt have any config options to enable or disable these LDB objects because that is supposed to be in your display mods options).

the icon will be the ammo's icon.  in the event you have no ammo the weapons icon will be used, in the event you have no ranged weapon equipped the empty ranged slot icon will be used.

ranged weapons that don't require ammo, eg wands or thrown, will only display durability (where applicable)

choose to include durability in the text or not


out of ammo: http://groups.google.com/group/wow-arkinventory/web/ArkInventory-LDB-Ammo-Empty.jpg

if item durability gets to 0 it will display broken in red as well
