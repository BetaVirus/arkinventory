= LDB (!LibDataBroker) Objects =

!ArkInventory comes with several LDB objects that you can chose to enable via your LDB display mod that you use.

(note that !ArkInventory doesnt have any config options to enable or disable these LDB objects because that is supposed to be in your display mods options).
