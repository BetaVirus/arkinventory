== Hiding (or displaying) a system or custom category or rule ==

When you assign a category to a bar its displayed by default.

If you want to hide a category from normal view (they always display in edit mode) you need to set the category mode to hidden.

  * Enter edit mode

  * Click on the bar where the category is assigned

  * Under `Categories assigned`, Mouse over the category type to bring up a list of categories.  You'll note that the categories are coloured either green (display) or red (hide)

  * Mouse over the category you want to alter to bring up the next menu

  * From that menu click `Hide` to toggle the categories hidden status

  * Exit Edit mode and your category will now be either hidden or displayed depending on the choice you made.
