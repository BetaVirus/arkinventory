= Categories =

== Hiding (or displaying) a category ==

When you assign a category to a bar its displayed by default.

If you want to hide a category from normal view (they always display in edit mode) you need to set the category mode to hidden.

  * Enter edit mode

  * Click on the bar where the category is assigned

  * Mouse over the category in question (you'll note that its either green or red)

  * From the sub menu chose either Hide (category will go red), or Display (category will go green)

  * Exit edit mode and your category will now be either hidden or displayed depending on the choice you made.
