  an alternate fix you can try - but will probably come back up if you have DHUD still loaded

  load up your character and open your bags, bank and keyring (doesnt matter if they're offline) and then enter the following into the chat window (one line at a time - copy and paste it)

  /script ARKINV_MainFrame1:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame2:SetFrameLevel( 3 )
  /script ARKINV_MainFrame3:SetFrameLevel( 3 )

  logout, log back in
