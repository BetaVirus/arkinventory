=How Items are assigned to a Category or Rule=

Every item has two assignments, it's default and a user allocated assignment.

The default assignment is based off basic item information, what professions you have and various other bits of info.  You cannot change this assignment.  It's effectively a best guess at where this item should be placed.  It's not always accurate as blizzard have some "errors" in category assignments and not everyone wants items categorised the same way.

The user allocated assignment is the one you give the item, either a custom category, an internal category, or a rule.  You can also remove this assignment (if applied) to revert the item back to it's default.

Obviously an item can't be in two places at once so it can only have one category assigned to it.  This category an item gets is assigned from the following order;

  * Check Custom Categories
  * then Check Internal Categories
  * then Check Rules

If an item isn't in any of the above then it has no user assigned category and will use it's default category instead.

The reason internal categories are checked before rules is so you can "hard code" an item to stay in one of the internal categories even if a rule would have picked it up.
