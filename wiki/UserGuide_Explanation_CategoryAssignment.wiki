=How Items are assigned to a Category or Rule=

Every item has two assignments, it's default and a user allocated assignment.

The default assignment is based off of basic item information, what professions you have and various other bits of info.  You cannot change this assignment.  It's effectively a best guess at where this item should be placed.  It's not always accurate as blizzard have some "errors" in their category assignments, there could be errors in my code, and not everyone wants items categorised the same way.

The user allocated assignment is the one you give the item, either a custom category, an internal category, or a rule.  You can also remove this assignment (if applied) to revert the item back to it's default.

Obviously an item can't be in two places at once so it can only have one category assigned to it.  The category an item gets is assigned in the following order;

  * has the item been assigned by the user to a Custom Category
  * has the item been assigned by the user to a System Category
  * does the item meet the requirements of a Rule

If an item isn't in any of the above then it has no user assigned category and will use it's default category instead.

The reason system categories are checked before rules is so you can "hard code" an item to stay in one of the system categories even if a rule would have picked it up.
