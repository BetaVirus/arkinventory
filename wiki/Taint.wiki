= Taint and Protected Functions =

what to do when wow says ai has used some protected function, or tainted something.


= Details =

start wow
enter the following on the chat line (copy and paste it)
/console taintLog 1
exit wow

start wow
play until you get the error
quit wow

check the logs\taint.log file and find the error
work backwards to find where the taint started

if you can find it then report it to the author of that mod
if you cant find it then submit the file in a ticket (dont expect a quick response because they arent fun reading)

start wow
enter the following on the chat line (copy and paste it)
/console taintLog 0
exit wow
start wow

ignore errors until the issue is fixed

note: there is a more detailed level of taint logging (2), you may be asked to provide another (much more detailed taint log) after enabling that, if i cant figure out where its coming from in the basic taint log.

please dont set it to 2 unless asked, i dont want to look through level 2 logs unless i absolutely have to.
