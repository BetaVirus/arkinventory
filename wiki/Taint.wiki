= Taint and Protected Functions =

!ArkInventory is an Ace3 based mod and uses several of its shared libraries, as such !ArkInventory is tagged as the owner of those libraries because it loaded them first (mods are loaded in alphabetical order and its usually first)

Because of this when another mod taints one of the globals that taint can spread through the shared libraries into every mod and eventually it will generate an error and blame !ArkInventory

What you can do to diagnose which mod was the actual cause is listed below

= Details =

  * start wow
  * enter the following on the chat line (copy and paste it)
  * `/console taintLog 1`
  * exit wow

 

  * start wow
  * play until you get the error
  * quit wow
 
 
  * check the logs\taint.log file and find the error
  * work backwards to find where the taint started

  * if you can find it then report it to the author of that mod
  * if you cant find it then submit the file in a ticket (dont expect a quick response because they arent fun reading)

  * start wow
  * enter the following on the chat line (copy and paste it)
  * `/console taintLog 0`
  * exit wow
  * start wow
  * ignore errors until the issue is fixed

note: there is a more detailed level of taint logging (2), you may be asked to provide another (much more detailed taint log) after enabling that, if i cant figure out where its coming from in the basic taint log.

please dont set it to 2 unless asked, i dont want to look through level 2 logs unless i absolutely have to.

You can read the log yourself or you can create a ticket and attach the log to it.

What you are looking for is the error at the end of the file, the variable that was tainted that caused the error, then go to the start of the file and see which mod actually tainted it first.  Sometimes it can be a chain of taint and it can take a bit of work to track it down but it can be done.

The usual cause is UIDROPDOWN variables but occasionally an author will forget to make a variable local and instead they stomp on a global that blizzard has used and taint it.
