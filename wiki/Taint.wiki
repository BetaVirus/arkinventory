= Tainted =

update this to hold detailed info on what to do when wow says ai has used some protected function, or tainted something.


= Details =

enable taint logging to max level

restart wow

play until you get the error

quit wow

check the taint.log and find the error

work backwards to find where the taint started

if you can find it then report it to the author of that mod
if you cant figure it out submit the file in a ticket (dont expect a quick response because they arent fun reading)

start wow

ignore errors until the issue is fixed
