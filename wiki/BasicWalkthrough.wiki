#summary Basic Walk-through - The basics of setting up ArkInventory for first time users

= Basic Walk-through =

This is your basic walk-though, it's enough to get you going but not enough to so you know everything there is to know about !ArkInventory (theres just way too much stuff for that and you'll probably never need to use it anyway)

Out of the box your bags will look like this, one really big bag.

Not very helpful per se, so where to start.

Sorting.  It's usually the first thing people want to change.  We've got one big bag with all our items all over the place, it's just a big mess.  We can't find anything if it's not sorted, now can we.  Well there is that pesky search bar just sitting there waiting for some input that might just help :)

Actually the first thing you need to know is how to open the config screen, because thats where most of the settings are changed;

 * Press *Escape* to bring up the blizzard menu
 * Click on *Interface* to bring up the blizzard configuration menu
 * Click on the *Addons* tab to show all addons that can be configured via this method
 * Find !ArkInventory in the list and click on that, its blizzard config screen should now be on the right hand side of the window

 * click on the *Config* button to open the !ArkInventory config screen

Now thats all a bit long and tedious but there is a shorter way.

Click on the !ArkInventory location icon (top left), the click on Config

Back to sorting.

Sorting in !ArkInventory is done via sort methods.  You can have as many or as few sort methods as you need to sort your items the way you want.

To create a Sort Method;
 * Open the config
 * Click on Sort Methods

http://groups.google.com/group/wow-arkinventory/web/ArkInventory-SortMethods.jpg

Here you see the system default sort method of Bag/Slot, it's disabled so you cant change anything for this method.

 * In the Add sort method entry field, enter a name for your sort method, we'll use *Standard*, and either press *Enter* or click on *Okay*, and you'll end up with a new sort method.

 * Click on your new sort method

As you can see, all the options are in red, this means they aren't being used.  We need to enable them first and then we can put them in the order we want.

 * Tick the box for the options you want enabled, in my case that's rarity, category, equip location and name

 * Once they're enabled we can move them up and down via the buttons

Now we have our sort method created we need to tell the bag to use it as its default sorting, otherwise it's just going to stay the way it is.

 * Click on Settings

 * You should already be on the Bag tab

 * Expand the Window option, if it's not already expanded

 * Click on Sorting

http://groups.google.com/group/wow-arkinventory/web/ArkInventory-SortMethod-Assign.jpg

 * Click on the Style dropdown and select the sort method we just created

Now open the bag and see the difference

While were here, we can also change the Borders, Backgrounds, and colours used.

(window>border, background, bar border, background, colour, item border, rarity, empty slots)

Thats the basics done, you can leave it like that, as one big bag if you like, it's nice and basic.  or you could put your items into groups so they're a bit easier to find and manage?

(keep going or split page?)

(groups are categories) (edit mode)

(bar layout, bar>category assignment, bar movement, category reassignment)

(item categories, item>category assignment, custom categories)

Rules, you've heard about them, think they're too complex and don't want to use them? well guess what?  thats perfectly fine, you don't have to use rules at all unless you have some very specific groupings you want to create that can't be handled by either the system or custom categories.

If you really want to figure out how to use the rules have a look at this (need link for that) page.
