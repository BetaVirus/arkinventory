#summary Basic Walk-through - The basics of setting up ArkInventory for first time users

= Basic Walk-through =

This is your basic walk-though, it's enough to get you going but not enough to so you know everything there is to know about !ArkInventory (theres just way too much stuff for that and you'll probably never need to use it anyway)

Out of the box your bags will look like this, one really big bag.

Not very helpful per se, so where to start.

Sorting.  It's usually the first thing people want to change.  We've got one big bag with all our items all over the place, it's just a big mess.  We can't find anything if it's not sorted, now can we.  Well there is that pesky search bar just sitting there waiting for some input that might just help :)

Actually the first thing you need to know is how to open the config screen, because thats where most of the settings are changed;

 * Press *Escape* to bring up the blizzard menu
 * Click on *Interface* to bring up the blizzard configuration menu
 * Click on the *Addons* tab to show all addons that can be configured via this method
 * Find !ArkInventory in the list and click on that, its blizzard config screen should now be on the right hand side of the window

 * click on the *Config* button to open the !ArkInventory config screen

Now thats all a bit long and tedious but there is a shorter way.

Click on the !ArkInventory location icon (top left), the click on Config

Back to sorting.

Follow these instructions [UserGuide_HowTo_Sorting How To > Sorting]

And now when we open the bag and see the difference the sorting makes

Thats the basics done.


There were other options you would have seen during this setup, your best bet is to just play with those settings and see if you like the results.  Most aren't hard to put back to their default, only the colours are a bit difficult but you can get close enough with those that it doesnt really matter.

One thing you do need to know about if you want to go any further and that is how the settings options work.

You can see in this image that the bag controls are set to use the bag settings - all the location controls default to using their own settings, but they don't have to.  If you want your bank to use the same settings as your bag then you can just change the settings option for it to bag and it'll end up looking the same
