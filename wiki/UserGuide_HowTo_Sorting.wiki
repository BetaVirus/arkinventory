= How to setup sorting =

Sorting in !ArkInventory is done via sort methods.  You can have as many or as few sort methods as you need to sort your items the way you want.

To create a Sort Method;
 * Open the config window
 * Click on Sort Methods

Here you see the system default sort method of Bag/Slot, it's options are all disabled so don't worry, you cant change anything for this method.  Default sort methods all start with `(*)`

 * In the Add sort method entry field, enter a name for your sort method, we'll use *Standard*, and either press *Enter* or click on *Okay*, and you'll end up with a new sort method.

 * Click on your new sort method

As you can see, all the options are in red, this means they aren't being used.  We need to enable them first and then we can put them in the order we want.

 * Tick the box for the options you want enabled, in my case that's rarity, category, equip location and name

 * Once they're enabled we can move them up and down via the buttons

Now we have our sort method created we need to tell the bag to use it as its default sorting, otherwise it's just going to stay the way it is.

 * Click on Settings

 * You should already be on the Bag tab

 * Expand the Window option, if it's not already expanded

 * Click on Sorting

 * Click on the Style dropdown and select the sort method we just created

 * There is also the option for when you want items resorted.
    * Tick `On Window Open` to sort your items only when the window is opened, new items added while the window is open will not get sorted.
    * Tick `Instant` to sort your items instantly, as soon as you use an item (eg ammo, potion) or pick up an item the window will sort (note that this can be intensive and should only be used if you really need it)
